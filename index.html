            techniques</b
          >. This 2<sup>nd</sup> generation computer was used from 1962 to 1971.
          It was built by <i>UKE</i>'s <i>University of Manchester</i>,
          <i>Ferranti International plc</i> and
          <i>Plessy company plc</i> jointly.

          <br />
          <br />
          Its main memory had 128 kB of 48-bit words. It had 2 HDDs (Hard Disk
          Drives) and several magnetic tape drives. It used discrete germanium
          transistors. It was finally shut down in October 1973.
